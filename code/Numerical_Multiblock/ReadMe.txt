The files can be run with MATLAB and R. 

<Description of codes> 

The files consist of three groups of codes as folows

1. Codes for Algorithms

master.m: this is the main code to run the following algorithms and save the results under the subfolder names "results".

For Example I, II, and III,

A1_M_BC.m: Runs M_BC algorithm
A2_H_BC.m: Runs H_BC algorithm
A3_S_BC.m: Runs S_BC algorithm
A4_M_BC_V.m: Runs M_BC_V algorithm
A5_M_BC_VS.m: Runs M_BC_VS algorithm

master_Rver.R: this is another main code to run the following algorithms and save the results under the subfolder names "results".

For Example IV and V,

A1_M_BC.R: Runs M_BC algorithm
A2_H_BC.R: Runs H_BC algorithm
A3_S_BC.R: Runs S_BC algorithm

2. Codes for backtracking linesearch functions: these codes are subcodes to run the algorithms

back0.m
back1.m
back2.m
back_with.m
back_without.m

3. Summary 
Summary.m: Report Tables.
Summary_Rver.R: Report Tables.

<Procedure to run codes>
1. Run master.m and master_Rver.R
2. Run Summary.m
3. Run Summary_Rver.R
